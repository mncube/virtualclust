Description: When student data has a nested structure, the statistical models
  often need to be adjusted for clustering. In some situations, the comparison
  group data is virtual data where first a many-to-one matching process is used
  to match treatment and control student data and then control students are
  summarized into one virtual control for each treatment student. The
  'virtualclust' package provides tools to simulate data and compare models for
  such data strucures. The sim_tc_cv() function is used to generate data while
  the vc_summary() function is used to compare results from statistical models.
