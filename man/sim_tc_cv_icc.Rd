}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{treatment_data}: A data frame of the treatment student data.
\item \code{control_data}: A data frame of the control student data.
\item \code{combined_data}: A merged data frame of the treatment data with the virtual control.
}
}
\description{
This function simulates clustered data for a treatment student group and a control student group,
performs propensity score matching based on pre-test scores, and summarizes the matched control students
to form a virtual control for each treatment student. Clustering in the treatment group is based on teachers,
and the level of clustering is controlled by the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC).
